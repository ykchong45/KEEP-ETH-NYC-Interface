# KEEP Finance

We present you the most capital-efficient lending protocol.

## Project Description

Keep Finance is a lending protocol that allows traders, lenders and suppliers to utilise the vast liquidity in lending protocols for margin trading. It will allow USDC, ETH and Matic to start. After the public deployment to crypto-holders, the protocol will also integrate a fiat on-ramp API to scale mass adoption by non-crypto-holders.

## How it's Made

We have built the protocol on Polygon and Optimism testnets with Hardhat. Users has an option to connect to the protocol with WalletConnect. On-chain prices for assets are pulled by Chainlink API and off-chain prices are pulled by Covalent API, all transactions are recorded in a subgraph using The Graph. The protocol is underpinned by 1inch swap contracts and the integration of the codes with their APIs presented a challenge that was overcome.
